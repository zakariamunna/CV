% Summary
\addblocktext{Summary}{I am an aspiring professional with a strong inclination towards the Network and Administration sector. With a foundation in server setup and maintenance and practical experience in Windows Server operating systems, I am committed to building a successful career in government roles. Through hands-on tasks, including Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS) and DNS configuration, I have developed skills in server management, group policy setup, and server hardening. My expertise extends to networking, subnetting, and file server configuration in Windows environments. Proficient in implementing and configuring Windows Server Update Service (WSUS), I bring a comprehensive understanding of network security, system administration, and server optimization. My practical experience, coupled with a commitment to continuous learning, positions me as a valuable asset in the dynamic field of Network and Administration.}
